# Anomaly-Detection-
This project focuses on integrating machine learning techniques into the domain of anomaly detection, highlighting the practical application of deep learning to identify anomalies in vibration signals. The project addresses the limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems, providing a more adaptive, scalable, and efficient solution.

### Our Focus: Vibration-Based Anomaly Detection
We focus on detecting anomalies in compressors by analyzing their vibration data. Vibrations are a rich source of information about a machineâ€™s health because they reflect how different parts are interacting and functioning. Using vibration data collected through accelerometers, we can track the movement and identify when something is not operating normally.

The challenge lies in how subtle some anomalies can be. For example, a compressor may still run but have tiny changes in its vibrations that hint at an underlying issue. To address this, we use machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional autoencoders. These models can learn the normal behavior of the compressor by analyzing historical vibration data. When new data deviates from this learned behavior, the model flags it as an anomaly.

Anomalies are often the first sign of a machine's potential failure, and identifying them early is essential for keeping operations efficient, safe, and cost-effective. By combining modern data analysis tools and machine learning, we can detect subtle changes in machine behavior that would otherwise go unnoticed. This project demonstrates the application of these technologies to monitor refrigerator compressors, providing a practical example of how anomaly detection can make a significant impact in industrial settings.
